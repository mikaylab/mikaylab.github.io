        <h1>COVID Couture</h1>
        <h3>An Empirical Study on Motivations and Practices of Mask
            Makers During A Crisis</h3>
        <hr class="line"/>

    <p>
       The landscape of everyday fashion was transformed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Part of this can be attributed to different
       types of communities (e.g. fashion, makers, sewing), who have designed and fabricated masks to counter global shortages and negative
       culture backlashes.
    </p>
    <p>
       In the summer of 2020, I have the privilege of working with <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/astar/" target="_blank">Asta Roseway</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/vnattar/" target="_blank">Vaishnavi Ranganathan</a>, and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/teddy/" target="_blank">Teddy Seyed </a>from Microsoft Resarch - Redmond to study the emergence of personal protective equipment (PPE) development by designers and makers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
       We performed a mix-methods study of individuals and groups within these communities on their 
       motivations and practices in designing and creating face masks during a global crisis. 
    </p> 
    <p>
    We surveyed 66 mask makers,
       and interviewed 23 of them about their attitudes and reflections on their mask making processes, their unique innovations, and the
       meaning of contributing in an impactful manner in local and global communities. We unpacked themes around self-expression and
       statement making, making and remixing, sustainable practices, as well as the role of design inspirations on methods and practices for
       mask makers during a crisis.
