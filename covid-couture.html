            <h4>Background</h4>
            <p>
                The landscape of everyday fashion has been transformed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Part of this can be attributed to different
                types of communities (e.g. fashion, makers, sewing), who have designed and fabricated masks to counter global shortages and negative
                culture backlashes.
             </p>
             <h4>Opportunity</h4>
             <p>
                In the summer of 2020, I have the privilege of working with 
                researchers from Microsoft Resarch - Redmond to study the emergence of personal protective equipment (PPE) development by designers and makers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
                We performed a mix-methods study of individuals and groups within these communities on their 
                motivations and practices in designing and creating face masks during a global crisis. 
             </p> 
             <h4>Process</h4>
             <p>
                We surveyed 66 mask makers,
                   and interviewed 23 of them about their attitudes and reflections on their mask making processes, their unique innovations, and the
                   meaning of contributing in an impactful manner in local and global communities. We unpacked themes around self-expression and
                   statement making, making and remixing, sustainable practices, as well as the role of design inspirations on methods and practices for
                   mask makers during a crisis.
            </p>
            <h4>Outcome</h4>
            <p>
                We published a <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3461778.3462016" target="_blank">paper based on this research at DIS 2021</a> where we earned an honorable mention. 
                I also wrote <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3495261" target="_blank">an article for XRDS</a> in relection of the creative resilience of mask makers 
                and others admist the pandemic.
