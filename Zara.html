        During the summer of 2019, I had the privilege of being selected out of 450+ applicants to be 1 of 40 Massachusetts Institute of Technology Summer Research Program  <a href="https://oge.mit.edu/graddiversity/msrp/" target="_blank">(MSRP)</a> interns. 
        My project entitled, <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/don-t-touch-my-hair-exploring-consent-education-through-interactive-art/overview/" target="_blank">‘(Don’t) Touch My Hair’</a>, is an interactive sculpture of a Black woman with an Afro that is meant to teach users how to respectfully explore one’s curiosity about Black hair. 
        I first developed an interaction storyline for the sculpture before implementing it into an Arduino program. (Don’t) Touch My Hair is inspired by the experience and history of discrimination against Black women for their hair.

        <figcaption>Front view of Zara’s head. In Zara’s wig there are sensors to detect touch: flex sensors to detect patting and switches to detect pulling of strands. The flex sensors are in the top and sides of the head. The switches are in the back of the head. The button in front of Zara’s head is for the user to ask Zara if they can touch her hair. </figcaption>
